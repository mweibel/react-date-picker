react-date-picker
=================

## Please note:
This is not the official repo. I created this repo because the official repo at [zippyui/react-date-picker](https://github.com/zippyui/react-date-picker) disappeared (the whole organisation did so).

This package is published as `react-date-picker-reborn` (`npm install react-date-picker-reborn`).
Unless someone is willing to take over, I'll just do maintenance. This means:
- No new features
- Bugs may get resolved
- PRs fixing bugs will be resolved
- Upgrades of dependencies will be done from time to time
